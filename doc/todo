complet their work.

Travel single linked list in the reverse order. Tip switch direction of the links - O(n) Check that the question is not

Block diagram for the bakcup system which target backup of the virtual machines - scalable, reliable. 
How many threads should be in the backup? Tip: if the CPU/IO is not a bottleneck and networking 
is the main bottleneck (typical) two thread read/write should be sufficient
to move the data between network interfaces
How to scale the system while keeping the united frontend/management system?
What is the performance of the modern I/O? Tip: consider 128 DDR bus. 
When the CPU will be a bottleneck? Tip: deduplication, real time compression
